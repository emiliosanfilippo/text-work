# text-work
The repository contains ontology-based patterns for the modeling of texts and (verbal) works.

In particular, it documents three different patterns in the Web Ontology Language (OWL):
* situated-text-pattern
* text-pattern
* work-pattern

For each pattern we present some queries for presentation/testing purposes. Also, each OWL file is duplicated for the pattern only (e.g., text-pattern.rdf) and the pattern populated with an example (text-pattern-example.rdf).
